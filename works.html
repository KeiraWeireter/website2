                        Sonny's Blues Analysis
                    </h2>
                    Baldwin responds to this quote with acknowledgement of its truth, yet offers a concurring opinion of it. Baldwin understands the greatest human tragedy of life itself, this suffering and grief that seems inherent with existance, but it acknowledges that life can move on in spite of this suffering. It is unable to be truly cured, yet people can still sing beauiful songs and play beautiful music, focusing on the joys of human existence despite the horribleness of it.

                    <h2>
                        Sonny's Blues Suffering Analysis
                    </h2>
                    Baldwin is trying to tell us that suffering is inevitable. Suffering is an inherent part of human existence and we spend our lives trying to avoid these feelings in any way we can. Some people succeed better than others, trying not to let the pain of human existence overwhelm them. However, this is a fact that everyone refuses to accept, rather than trying to distract themselves or ease the pain in whatever way we can rather than wallowing in it.
Baldwin attributes this suffering to various different sources. One of these sources of suffering is our environment. The characters in this novel live in oftentimes dark or dangerous places. Our environment may often be unwelcoming, “black and funky and cold,” (pg), a surrounding that would be obviously depressing for someone to live in. A part of this suffering is external, created by a city that looks coldly upon its inhabitants.
Yet this suffering also comes from within. It is a suffering tied to the human experience, one that the narrator admits that there is no avoidance of, that “there's no way not to suffer,” (16). This suffering is simply part of life, and it is experienced by all simply on the merit of being human.
Sonny’s obsession with blues and jazz is simply an extension of this. Sonny is able to find an escape from this suffering with music. He has intertwined music with grief, existence as the opposite of it, as a remedy for this feeling. Music is also inherent in the human condition, enjoyed by hundreds of generations who all felt the same suffering. He plays this music to cope with his personal suffering, seeing it as a temporary escape from it.

                        Macbeth
                    </h2>
                    Macbeth is a highly complex character. Throughout the play, he is constantly battling himself. He is fighting against his own ambition and his morals. Macbeth balances the role of a guilty sinner and a cunning killer, existing in a complex state of mind between the two. He kills for his own gain and then reflects upon it with regret, realizing that he has damned himself but yet continues down a path, a path that he already knows will destroy him.
This complexity serves the themes of doubles and paradoxes. Macbeth has become a man that is both fair and foul, these two states constantly pushing each other. He has become twisted by the witches' prophecy into a man that has lost his peace, haunted by his own mind at the reflection of his actions.
