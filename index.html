                Hello everyone who stumbles upon my website. This is a placeholder website for an eventual writing platform in which I will share my works with the world. However, right now, I am simply filling up space as I have not established myself and prefer to use this space as a way for me to have this later and keep it looking nice right now.

            <div class ="twin">
                <div class = "container">
                    <h2>
                        Info
                    </h2>
                    Wow, writing? Yeah, what can I say? I'm a silly goose here to spread my silly creative mind with the world. What do I write? Good question! I write a lot of fantasty and bildungsroman books. However, due to the sheer stress of school, I do not spend a lot of time writing. Instead, I spend my days doing calculus homework and deriving and such and such.

                <div class = "container">
                    <h2>
                        Info
                    </h2>
                    Another info box? What can I say? I like to spread knowledge. Wisdom. I like doubles and symmetry, these two boxes acting as a balancing mechanic with the above box. It creates almost the image of a pyramid, a popular compositional motif in art. You can see such triangles in works such as Liberty Leading the People by Delacroix. He is unfortunatly French though :(
